## Metabolomics Data Sharing
Data sharing is being increasingly required by journals and has been heralded as a solution to the ‘replication crisis’. This work aimed to (i) review data sharing policies of journals publishing the most metabolomics papers associated with open data and (ii) compare these journals’ policies to those that publish the most metabolomics papers. A PubMed search was used to identify metabolomics papers. Metabolomics data repositories were manually searched for linked publications. It was found that journals that most support data sharing are not necessarily those with the most papers associated to open metabolomics data. Further efforts are required to improve data sharing in metabolomics.

This analysis code is to accompany the paper: [A lost opportunity for science: journals promote data sharing in metabolomics but do not enforce it](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11306-017-1309-5).
